<h2>Who I am:</h2>
<p>
       I am a "near" 30 year old who studied culinary arts. I consider myself pretty geeky (as much as anyone else taking this course probably).
    I was born in Mexico city, but moved and grew up for half my life in the US. (someone say Texas?)
    I dabble in playing the guitar in high school, and enjoyed playing sports. I was in the little league 
    for 3 years(won second place my first!). Then I transitioned to tennis. I was top of my tennis class and almost entered tournaments,
    but sadly my parents decided to move back to Mexico. After that I finished high school, and worked for 2 years while I decided on a career.
    I tranistione from Engineering to Pilot before moving to Waterloo, Ontario to do computer science. Waterloo was boting and I ended up moving to the city.
    Here is where I learned to really cook. 3 years later I realized the cooking industry is a big lie and made the switch to bartending. fastforward 1 year and 
    BOOM, pandemic hits. <br>
</p>
<p>
      I quickly realized after covid that I needed to get out of the food industry QUICK. I've had to deal with racism and abusive chefs
      for 3 years. Luckily, I had some free time to take some online programming courses taught by Harvard proferssors so I thought, why not?
      My girlfriend was the genius who told me to sign up to this bootcamp as a test run to see if I would like data analysis. It's safe to say she's the
      brains in our relationship because now I'm part of the META-B squad and theyre an amazing group. We have great chemistry and figure things out together.
      I couldn't be happier with my team ... and this course!<br>
